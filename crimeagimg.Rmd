### R Markdown for Crime in 2018 by Victim Type

```{r reading in 2015 crime file}
# I determined early on what columns would need to be cast for my
# crime data files for 2015 to 2019. I used the same casting for
# all five of these files. I had issues with the 2016 file, though,
# because it was missing a longitude column. I contacted the
# Portland Police Bureau, however, and they fixed it, which was
# pretty cool.

a <- read_csv(file = "cleaned-data/CrimeData-2015.csv", col_types = cols(
  Address = col_character(),
  CaseNumber = col_character(),
  CrimeAgainst = col_character(),
  Neighborhood = col_character(),
  OccurDate = col_character(),
  OccurTime = col_character(),
  OffenseCategory = col_character(),
  OffenseType = col_character(),
  OpenDataLat = col_double(),
  OpenDataLon = col_double(),
  OpenDataX = col_character(),
  OpenDataY = col_character(),
  ReportDate = col_character(),
  OffenseCount = col_double()
))
```

```{r 2015 crime against plot and image}
# I originally had all of the code in this Rmd in an R script file
# that I had been using to build my project. Because of issues I
# was having with my images printing in Shiny properly, I decided
# to switch how I was saving my plots as images based off of a
# recommendation Bernadette gave me.

crimeag15 <- ggplot(a, aes(x = CrimeAgainst, fill = CrimeAgainst)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Crimes per Victim Type in 2015") +
  xlab("Type of Victim") +
  ylab("Count") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  theme_minimal()

# Prior to this, I had been using ggsave in a similar way. Bernadette
# said she found the method below online because she was having similar
# issues with getting her images to load properly. Because this method
# doesn't employ pipes, having it split into "runnable" code chunks
# in an Rmd made more sense than leaving it in its origianl R script.
