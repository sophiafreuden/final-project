### R Markdown for Differing Crime Rates Plotted Over Time and Precitions

```{r reading in data for 2015 crime}
# I do more or less the same thing across multiple Rmd files,
# but I call the data something different every time. I'm not
# entirely should how the environment in R Studio works for
# saved objects. I don't know if you save data as an object
# in R for use in one Rmd that you will be able to call the
# same object in another Rmd. I always read them into new
# objects and name them something different.

```{r modifying the date columns with lubridate}
# Lubridate is a helpful package that we have been

# a PDF that is incredibly helpful.

# and Report Date, even though I only work with Occur
# Date moving forward. I did this for consistency's
# sake, though this is somewhat unnecessary.
